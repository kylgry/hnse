##handshake name system explorer

One of the key features of the explorer will be to recursively ping network nodes for their peers, and compile a list of all network nodes. An API will be used to then get the geolocation of each IP. The compiled table should simply be two columns, the IP address and geolocation.

Table Network Nodes
Columns ip - geolocation

The explorer will primarily make direct api calls to a handshake node - the blockchain is the database! But users will be able to create an account and favorite names, addresses, and transactions. 

Table Users
Columns username - password

Table Favorites
columns username - url
